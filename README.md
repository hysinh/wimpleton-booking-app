## Introduction
Wimpleton House Booking website is a full-stack web application created with HTML, CSS, JS, Python, the Django web framework and the Bootstrap library. This website application allows users to view a fictional Irish country estate that hires out it's buildings and grounds for special events. Visitors to the website are able to view the different venue hire options. Upon registering as a user of the website and logging in, users are then able to request to book a particular venue option for a specific date. This booking request reserves the chosen venue for the chosen date and prevents another user from booking the same venue for the same date. Users have access to a Booking Dashboard which allows them to view and manage their bookings.

## User Experience
The goal of the Wimpleton House Booking website is to provide a business tool that allows the business to engage meaningfully with potential clients. The website offers information about the different Venue hire options for the estate and then allows visitors to register as users and create, view, edit, and delete booking requests with the estate.

Although some events may be one-off events like a wedding, the estate has a goal of creating ongoing relationships with event planners, businesses, corporations, and communities for events that potentially could be annual, bi-annual, quarterly, or even more frequent and facilitates clients managing their bookings and review past booking records.
- ### Visitor Goal
  As a user, I want to easily view potential venue hire options at the Wimpleton House estate, to create a booking, and to view and manage all my bookings.
- ### User stories
  1. User looking to purchase a home and wants to compare different mortgages by percentage rate, loan length, lifetime interest, and monthly payment.
  2. User looking to refinance a home and wanting to compare current loan data with new potential loans by loan length, monthly payment, and overall cost of the loan.
  3. User wanting to add a loan for comparison.
  4. User wanting to compare how monthly payments affects their loan.
  5. User wanting to compare how a lump principal affects their loan.
  6. User wanting to save loans they want to keep for comparison.
  7. User wanting to see the amortization schedule of a loan that they have entered. 


## Data Model
### Design 
  This project utilizes Object Oriented Programming and centers around one main class, Mortgage.

  The majority of the calculations are done via methods on that Mortgage class. 

### Flowchart
  Created in draw.io, the following flowchart provides a visualization of the planning process for this application. During the development of the application, it became apparent that additional inputs, functionality, and outputs were required for the implementation for some of the calculations required and to better organise the options in a way that made sense to the user.

  An example of this additional development is for principal overpayments. Originally, I had them as separate options. But based on initial user testing and feedback, I decided to combine them in the same menu option and allowing the user to select which type of overpayment they would make. This helped the organise the menu in a more logical way to the user.

## Features
### Logo
<details >
<summary></summary>  

![screenshot card grid](docs/documentation/screenshot_logo.png)
</details>  
The Logo of the Mortgage Calculator is diplayed using ASCII. 

### Menu
<details>
<summary></summary>

![screenshot of main menu](docs/documentation/screenshot_main_menu.png)
</details>
A Main Menu displays to explain the options to the user. The User is given a reminder message that they can enter 0 at any juncture that prompts the user to make a main menu selection to view the menu. 

### Input Validation
<details>
<summary></summary>

![screenshot of input validation](docs/documentation/screenshot_input_validation.png)
</details>
When user input is required, input is validated to ensure that the input is within the parameters set. For example, if the user is required to input the APR (Annual Percentage Rate). The user is given an example of the format in the prompt and the input is validated as a float between 0 and 100. If the user inputs something that is not a number, a red error message is printed to the terminal stating the error and prompts the user to try again. If the user enters a number that is not within the paraments, in this case a negative number or a number greater than 100, a red error message is printed to the terminal and the user is prompted again to input a valid input. 

### Add Mortgages
<details>
<summary></summary>

![screenshot of add mortgages](docs/documentation/screenshot_add_mortgage.png)
</details>
The user is allowed to add as many mortgages as they choose. Each mortgage is asked for user input for the name (or label) for the mortgage, principal amount, APR, and mortgage length. The monthly payment and lifetime interest is then calculated and printed on the terminal along with the mortgage inputs provided by the user. The user is then prompted to decide if they want to save this mortgage for their session. If the user chooses Yes, the mortgage is saved and the user is redirected back to the Main Menu options. If the user chooses not to save the mortgage, the user is redirected back to the Main Menu.

### View Mortgages
<details>
<summary></summary>

![screenshot of view mortgages](docs/documentation/screenshot_view_mortgage.png)
</details>
The user is allowed to view the details of any individual Mortgage profile that they have saved during their session. If they selected the View Mortgage menu option, but have NOT entered in any mortgages, they will receive an error message and will be prompted to make a different choice from the main menu. If there are mortgages saved, the user is provided with a list of the available Mortgage profiles and they can enter in a mortgage number that corresponds with their saved mortgages to view the details for that individual mortgage. After the mortgage details are printed to the terminal, the user is prompted to choose a different mortgage to view or to return to the main menu and exit the View Mortgages section.


### Compare Mortgages
<details>
<summary></summary>

![screenshot of footer](docs/documentation/screenshot_compare_mortgages.png)
</details>
When the user has saved a minimum of two Mortgages, they can view a mortgage comparison table that displays the morgage name, principal amounts, APR, loan length, monthly payments, and lifetime interest. If the user has saved a minimum of two Mortgages, a red error message displays alerting them of the problem. The user can then select an option that allows them to create and save a Mortgage in the session. 

### Overpayments
<details >
<summary></summary>  

![screenshot overpayments](docs/documentation/screenshot_overpayments.png)
</details>  
There are two options in the Overpayments feature: 1) Additional Monthly Principal overpayments and 2) A Lump Principal Payment. Once this feature is selected, the user is required to choose which type of Overpayment they would like to calculate.

- ### Additional Monthly Principal Overpayment
  <details >
  <summary></summary>  

  ![screenshot monthly overpayments](docs/documentation/screenshot_overpayments_monthly.png)
  </details>  
  The user is prompted to input basic mortgage details as well as an amount for the extra monthly payments. This input is then used to calculate a Mortgage profile and prints both the profile and an amortization schedule based on the new calculations. The user is given the option to save this mortgage to their mortgages when the calculations are completed.

- ### Lump Principal Overpayment
  <details >
  <summary></summary>  

  ![screenshot lump overpayments](docs/documentation/screenshot_overpayments_lump.png)
  </details>  
  The user is prompted to input basic mortgage details as well as an amount for the lump payment to be applied to the Principal balance. This input is then used to calculate a Mortgage profile and prints both the original profile inputed and then an updated Mortgage profile. The user is given the option to save this updated mortgage to their mortgages when the calculations are completed.


### Amortization Schedule
<details >
<summary></summary>  

![screenshot amortization](docs/documentation/screenshot_amortization.png)
</details>  
This option requires at least one saved Mortgage profile. If there is an insufficient number of Mortgage profiles, the user is alerted with a red error message and redirected back to the Main menu options. If there is at least one Mortgage profile, it is printed in a list and the user is asked to input a Mortgage Profile selection. Once selected, the amortization schedule is calculated and printed to the terminal. The user can either choose another Mortgage profile to view or can exit to the main menu. 


### Mortgage Data Analysis
<details >
<summary></summary>  

![screenshot amortization](docs\documentation\screenshot_mortgage_data_analysis.png)
</details>  
When this option is selected, the data stores in a Google Sheet is retrieved and the average is calculated for each of the following catergories and printed for the user to view and compare inputed averages of all users to their own mortgage needs.
  - Average Principal Amount
  - Average APR
  - Average Loan Length
  - Average Monthly Payment
  - Average Lifetime Interest

### Exit Program
<details >
<summary></summary>  

![screenshot exit](docs/documentation/screenshot_exit.png)
</details> 
Should the user which to exit the Mortgage Comparison Tool, they can select option 6 from the Main menu. When this option is selected, the terminal is cleared and a Thank you message is printed before the program is terminated. 

### Future Development
- For future development, I wanted to implement a table of data analysis of the aggregate mortgage data inputed by users to provide insight into the type of mortgages that user want to compare. Examples of potential insights would be average mortgage principal amount, average length of the mortgage, and average APR. 
- I noticed that other students implemented custom heroku terminal shell for deployment. I thought this was interesting and would like to implement this should I have more time to develop this further.
- At the moment, the user is limited to 10 characters when naming their mortgage. This limit could be raised, but I would need additional time to ensure that that the printed output would be limited to a certain character length so that it doesn't not disrupt the layout of the comparison table.
- During testing, it was revealed that when users save Mortgage profiles after applying Extra Monthly Principal payments, the mortgage profile that is saved is based on the original Mortgage inputs and is not updated with the new loan length and lifetime interest on the loan. For a future feature, I would like to be able to recalculate the updated length of the loan and the lifetime loan interest. With these updated values, users could then save this updated mortgage profile into their session to use to compare against other saved mortgages.

  | Table needs to display Mortgage name rather than Mortgage key | Amortization Schedule | Replace print statement with mortgage name variable rather than Mortgage key |
  | Unexpected indentation | Main Menu Prompt| Removes backslash from string |

  
  ### Unfixed Bugs
  - Although I have included a function that clears the terminal, I noticed that anything above the terminal screen does not clear and is still available to view if you scroll up. This is potentially confusing but I was not able to resolve it. My mentor said that it is common for older terminals to push content upward and not truly clear the screen.
  - When viewed through a mobile device, the terminal goes off screen. I will need to research this to see if this is something that is resolvable.
  
  ### Unresolved Linter Code Errors

  | Bug | Line | Unresolved Reason |
  | --- | ---- | --- |
  | Line length | 111 | I tried several different places to attempt to break up the lines to stay <79 but it resulted in poor print outcomes. |
  | Line length | 121 | I tried to delete the extra spaces in the formula but it caused "missing white space around operator" errors. |
